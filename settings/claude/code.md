## Skills-First Workflow (MANDATORY)

BEFORE starting any task:

1. Ask: "Does ANY available skill match this request?"
2. If yes → Use Skill tool to load and execute it
3. Announce which skill you're using
4. Follow the skill exactly

See using-superpowers skill (auto-injected at session start) for full protocol.

**Critical:** If a skill exists for your task, you MUST use it. "This is simple" or "I remember it" = rationalizations. Check for skills BEFORE acting.
